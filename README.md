# This is the control file for FluoSpec systems using a Raspberry Pi III.

The FluoSpec system uses two Ocean Optics spectrometers (HR-2000 and QE-Pro) to monitor the canopy reflectance and the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF).

This code is based on the Seabreeze library written in C language.
